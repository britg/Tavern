# Adventurers

Adventurers are the "population" - they are the atomic unit that the sim runs off of.

## Mechanics

- Adventurers will go about their business without interaction from the player
- Can't be moved or directly controlled
- Named
- Have levels, experience and a preparedness rating


## Adventurer Needs

- Supplies 
	- reliant on class/level
	- spends money on supplies
	- re-supplies when needed
	- buys enough for one day? (Upgrade inventory to carry more)
	- If they don't have some necessary supplies, they can still quest, but they are unhappy.
